# 📚 Book Recommender System

Welcome to the **Book Recommender System**! This project is a Streamlit-based application that provides personalized book recommendations using a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model, and a collaborative filtering approach via SVD.

---

## 🔍 Features

### 🔢 General Statistics
- Displays the total number of books and users in the dataset.

### 🎮 Popular Books
- Shows the most popular books based on the number of ratings.

### 🌟 Top-Rated Books
- Highlights the top-rated books in the dataset.

### 🔍 Recommendations
- Provides book recommendations based on user selection.
- Allows users to rate recommendations and save their feedback.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Advanced Search
- Search for books by keywords.

### 🌐 Random Book Discovery
- Discover a random book from the dataset.

### 🎨 Visualizations
- View distributions of ratings and user interactions with books.

## 💪 Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the kNN recommendation algorithm.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading the pre-trained model and datasets.
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: For collaborative filtering-based recommendations.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommender-system.git
   cd book-recommender-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the required data and model files in the `artifacts/` directory:
   - `knn_model.pkl`
   - `svd_model.pkl`
   - `book_titles.pkl`
   - `book_df.pkl`

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
